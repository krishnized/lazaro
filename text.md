When the name Cuba is mentioned, many people think of a Caribbean island where joy, good weather, and beaches abound. But behind that image, there is a people that has suffered for more than 60 years under a communist system, facing restricted political, economic, and religious freedoms, including the imposition of atheism.

Although the doors have recently opened slightly to some religious practices, the poor economic situation persists. Amid these conditions, there is a large community of yoga practitioners and a general openness towards spiritual topics. Recognizing the potential for spiritual enlightenment, a few months ago we began sending boxes of transcendental books to distribute freely. The reception has been amazing!

Despite our efforts, the demand has quickly exceeded our capacity to supply everyone who has requested books, given the expenses involved in purchasing, shipping, and distributing them across different provinces. Thanks to your invaluable help, we will be able to send 50 boxes of books to Cuba, which, based on the demonstrated interest, is the necessary amount to further our reach. These books have so far been delivered to practitioners from the main yoga studios in Havana, and we plan to extend this distribution throughout the country.

In one occasion Srila Prabhupada told to his disciple Harikesha that because people in communist countries were suffering so much he should give them books without making them pay.

Also in 1973 emphasized the importance of our mission:
“There is no doubt about it, to distribute books is our most important activity. Fight with maya means to drop thousands and millions of books into the lap of the conditioned souls. Just like during wartime the bombs are raining from the sky like anything.”

Srila Prabhupada Ki Jay!!!

Your support is critical: It enables us to purchase books, cover the shipping costs, and ensure they reach the right recipients. We invite you to become a part of Krishna Consciousness history in Cuba by contributing to our campaign. Every donation matters.

Hare Krishna!
