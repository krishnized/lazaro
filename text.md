When the name Cuba is mentioned, many people think of a Caribbean island where joy, good weather, and beaches abound. But behind that image, there are people who have suffered for more than 60 years under a communist regime, facing restricted political, economic, and religious freedoms, including the imposition of atheism.

Although the doors have recently opened slightly to some religious practices, the poor economic situation persists. Amid these conditions, there is a large community of yoga practitioners and a general openness towards spiritual topics. Recognizing the potential for spiritual enlightenment, some of us, devotees of Cuban origin living in North America, have recently taken up the project to give back to our country the gift we have been given. A few months ago, we began sending boxes of transcendental books to distribute freely. The reception has been amazing!

Despite our efforts, the demand has quickly exceeded our capacity to supply everyone who has requested books from us, given the expenses involved in purchasing, shipping, and distributing them across different provinces. As a special push for this important mission this year, we are pleading for your help to increase our capacity. Thanks to your invaluable help, we will be able to send 50 boxes of books to Cuba, which, based on the demonstrated interest, is the necessary amount to further our reach. These books have so far been delivered mostly to practitioners from the main yoga studios in Havana, but we plan to extend this distribution throughout the country.

On one occasion, Srila Prabhupada told his disciple Harikesha Swami that because people in communist countries were suffering so much, he should give them books without making them pay.

Also, in a 1973 letter he emphasized the importance of our mission, where he writes:
“There is no doubt about it, to distribute books is our most important activity. Fight with maya means to drop thousands and millions of books into the lap of the conditioned souls. Just like during wartime the bombs are raining from the sky like anything.”

Srila Prabhupada Ki Jay!!!

Your support is critical: It enables us to purchase books and ensure that the right people receive them. We invite you to become a part of Krishna Consciousness history in Cuba by contributing to our campaign. Every donation matters.

Thank you very much. Hare Krishna!
